Final project for Web Application Development Grade.

-- EASYWEB --

Kind of a "template". It can be implemented in a business and is easily customizable.
In this app, you can create your own database tables and relations without database knowledge.
That's so you can manage your business / have your own web in no time.

That's the backend. Developed using:
- .NET 8
- EntityFramework
- Microservices
- Repositories
- Units of work
- Middleware (ocelot)
